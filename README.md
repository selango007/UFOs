# 1.0 Overview of the Analysis
The overview of this project is to enhance the search criteria for UFO sighting with multiple filters, in order to get help the user a more specific search results.


# 2.0 Results
Before the enhancement, the user could search for UFO signtings only on dates. If the user is interested to get the results of UFO sightings in a specific City or State or Country, it was not supported.

With the enhanced search criteria, the user has options to input multiple search criterias like, Date, City, State, Country and Shape to narrow down the search results.

For Example:

1.  If the user want to find all UFO sightings on 1/1/2010 in San Diego, it can be done by inputing Date: 1/1/2010; City: San Diego which provides 3 results.
2.  If the user want to search for all Triangle shaped UFO sightings in California, it can be done by inputing Shape: triangle, State: ca which gives us 7 results.


# Summary
This filter supports one or multiple search criterias which is a significant impovement compared to the older version.

However one biggest drawback is, this filter criteria is case sensitive. If the user enters state as Ca, it might not return all results which has the state as CA or ca. Hence the results might not be accurate.

It is recommended to add dropdown list to have a control over the filter criterias.

Example: The search criteria can be in Country, State, City order and based on the Country selected, the list of state shall be populated and same with City.

Another improvement that is recommended is to add duration to the filter criteria.
